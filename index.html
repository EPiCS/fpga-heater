          <h3>Overview</h3>

          <p>For studying thermal properties of FPGAs (e.g., for building thermal models or for investigating fault-tolerance methods for mitigating temperature induced soft-errors) it is important to have hardware cores that can generate large amounts of heat. In our publication "M. Happe, H. Hangmann, A. Agne, and C. Plessl. <i>Eight ways to put your FPGA on fire – a systematic study of heat generators.</i> In Proc. Int. Conf. on ReConFigurable Computing and FPGAs (ReConFig), pages 1–8. IEEE Computer Society, Dec. 2012." we have presented a study that evaluated several methods for intentionally generating heat on FPGAs. This projects make the best performing heat generator from this study (oscillators implemented in LUTs) available as open-source hardware, that is, a pcore that can be embedded in Xilinx EDK designs. The amount of heat can be regulated in 32 levels.
